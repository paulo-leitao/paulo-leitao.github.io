# Portfolio Project

A simple project proposed by **DIO** in the HTML and CSS module from the **TQI Bootcamp**.

Here we can see some effects made completely using CSS:

- Linear gradient animation

- Cards on hover animation

- Menu effect

## New Features:

After that I decided to implement a simple javascript to disable the menu when the user click anywhere on the screen or when some menu item is selected.
